# Airbnb Clone Project

[Link to the app](https://amazon-clone-project-donovan.vercel.app/)

This Clone project was recently build with react alone. I decided to migrate my work from a simple react application to a nextjs application in order to improve my skills with this framework.

- User Authentication powered by firebase

- Order inventory provided by firebase through the firestore

- Real ecommerce system and payment capabilities using stripe

# Technologies I used

**NEXT JS**
